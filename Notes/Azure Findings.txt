FINDING:

you cannot increase a storage spaces pool size by expanding the existing disks
there is no command to do that
you can only add disks to an already storage pool in order to increase the virtual disk


so if you have 4 disks of 1tb in a vm
and have set them up in a storage pool 
(it's irrelevant if you have created a virtual disk or not)

and then you detach them, increase their size (let's say make them double size)
and then re-attach the disks.

You'll see your storage pool as before, but you won't be able to increase its
size. Although you'll be able to see the left space in the physical disks.


FINDING 2:

you cannot reduce the size of a managed disk in Azure

when changing the size of a managed disk, you can only increase its capacity
